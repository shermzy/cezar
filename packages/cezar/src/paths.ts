 * profile, i.e. the wrong account's file.
 *
 * The condition below reads like two heuristics OR-ed together; it is one exact rule. The file sits
 * inside precisely when the CLI will SEE `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for this dir, and cezar knows when
 * that is:
 *
 *   - a stored account is always spawned with it (`profileEnv`), and its dir is by construction not
 *     `~/.claude` — the route refuses a dir that is already the discovered account's;
 *   - the DISCOVERED account is spawned with nothing added, so it sees the variable only when the
 *     cezar process itself carries one — and it does reach the child, because `CLAUDE_` is in
 *     `BACKEND_ALLOW_PREFIXES`.
 *
 * One case is worth naming because it looks like a bug and is not. Start cezar with
 * `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/opt/work` and add `~/.claude` as a NAMED account (legal — the discovered
 * account is `/opt/work`, so `~/.claude` is not a duplicate). This answers `~/.claude/.claude.json`,
 * not the sibling `~/.claude.json`, and "Show details" can therefore say "not signed in" for a
 * folder a bare `claude` would treat as signed in. That is correct rather than unfortunate: cezar
 * will run that account as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude claude`, and under that invocation the
 * state file the CLI reads and writes IS the one inside. Reporting the sibling would describe a
 * login this account will never use.
