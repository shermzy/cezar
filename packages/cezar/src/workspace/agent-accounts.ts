/**
 * `~/.cezar/agent-accounts.json` — the agent-accounts store (spec `2026-07-29-agent-profiles.md`).
 *
 * ## Why its own file
 *
 * These keys started life in `config.json`, where their survival across a cezar downgrade rested
 * on a `.passthrough()` modifier in the OTHER version's schema. That held for the versions in
 * this repo's history — measured, not assumed — but it is not a guarantee this repo can make on
 * behalf of a build someone switches to, and it fails completely in the one case that matters
 * most: any version that cannot parse `config.json` degrades to in-memory defaults, and its next
 * merge-write rewrites the file without whatever it did not understand.
 *
 * A version that has never heard of accounts does not open THIS file, so it cannot lose them.
 * That is the entire argument, and it is why the selections live here too rather than on the
 * project registry.
 *
 * ## House rules (the same ones `config.json` follows, for the same reasons)
 *
 * - every field optional/defaulted with `.catch`, so a bad value degrades per key;
 * - `.passthrough()` at every object level, so a NEWER cezar's keys survive an older one;
 * - per-entry salvage for `accounts` — one hand-edited row never evicts the rest;
 * - atomic tmp+rename at `0600` through the shared writer;
 * - a corrupt or unreadable file degrades to empty with ONE warning, never a boot failure.
 *
 * ## Identity
 *
 * Selections are keyed by the project's REALPATH'D ROOT, not its registry slug. The root is what
 * every consumer already has in hand (`resolveProfileEnvForRoot` takes it), it survives the
 * registry being rebuilt, and it means this file needs no cross-reference into `config.json` at
 * all. An orphaned entry — a project the user deregistered — resolves to nothing and is inert.
