   * the wait returns, so a case that starts from this baseline states the age it is testing
   * (`+10 s`, `+2 h`) instead of inheriting one from the machine.

   * (`vi.waitFor` nudges an installed fake clock by one poll interval per poll, so the clock
   * does drift forward at roughly real-time pace *during* a wait. That is bounded and far below
   * the 60 s ceiling — it would take ~1000 polls to reach it — and it stops on return, which is
