/**
 * The cockpit's WebSocket subscription bus (`GET /api/v1/ws`, upgrade-only).
 * Design + the subscribe/unsubscribe discipline: spec
 * `.ai/specs/2026-07-23-websocket-subscriptions.md`.
 *
 * One socket per cockpit, many topics per socket: the client sends
 * `{type:'subscribe'|'unsubscribe', topic}` frames and receives
 * `{type:'event', topic, data}` frames for the topics it holds. The point of
 * the topic layer is that server-side work is DEMAND-DRIVEN: a topic's
 * publisher starts when its subscriber count goes 0→1 and is stopped at 1→0,
 * so a workspace with no cockpit open (or a cockpit that navigated away from
 * everything using a topic) costs zero timers, zero shell-outs, zero anything.
 * That is what replaced the per-tab `GET /api/health` poll (#369): N tabs used
 * to mean N polls every 5 s forever; now they mean one publisher while at
 * least one tab subscribes, and none afterwards.
 *
 * Security: the hub itself never decides who may connect — `attach` takes the
 * upgrade guard as a function, and server.ts supplies the WebSocket twin of
 * the `/api/*` request-origin guard (#426). See `verifyWsUpgrade` there for
 * what it admits, and the caveat about which topics may live on this hub.
