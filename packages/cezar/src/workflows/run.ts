   *
   * ONE helper for BOTH turn-end handlers — `runAgentStep` (the run's first session) and
   * `runContinuation` (a resumed one). They are near-identical by construction, and a lifecycle
   * change applied to only one of them ships half a fix (#811; AGENTS.md § "Changing a mechanism

   *  - the cap: at `MAX_AUTO_CONTINUES` this returns `false` and the turn parks exactly as a
   *    non-autonomous one does today — `waiting` (or `monitoring`), idle timer armed, slot freed;
   *  - `cancel` (`state.cancelled`) and the memory-limit pause (which clears `state.autonomous`,
   *    see `enforceMemoryLimit`) each stop it before the next nudge;
   *  - the session ending for any reason (agent exit, crash, `finish`, idle timeout) leaves
   *    through the normal exit path — `sendMessage` on a closed session returns false, so a dead
   *    session parks rather than silently looping;
   *  - a NATIVE `ask.requested` (Claude's AskUser, Codex's `requestUserInput` bridge — #473,
   *    #565) still parks the run at `waiting` MID-turn through `handleRunnerUiEvent`, which
   *    carries no autonomous guard. That is the one exit the nudge does not currently cover:

   * A turn ended on nothing but the backend compacting its own context (#955). Keep the run

   * Compaction is internal session maintenance. It is not the agent saying anything, so it is
   * not evidence that the user owns the next action — but by the time `turn/completed` reaches
   * here it looks exactly like a turn that DID hand over, which is why a long Codex task that
   * crossed its context window was parked mid-work with nobody to answer it.
   *
   * The precedence this sits UNDER, and why each one wins (`BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` §8 —
   * an emitted marker means what it meant when the session started):
   *  - `CEZ:DONE` — already returned before this is reached, at both sites;
   *  - `CEZ:ASK` — the agent has a question on the user's screen; continuing would answer it
   *    for them;
   *  - `CEZ:MONITORING` — the agent said it is still working on its OWN downstream work, which
   *    is a park it chose, not one compaction imposed;
   *  - a turn that DISPATCHED — it waits on its children and owes them its slot;
   *  - the budget brake, cancellation, a closed session;
   *  - the autonomous nudge, which the callers try first: an autonomous run continues anyway,
   *    and two nudges for one turn would be two messages into one session.
   * Everything left is a MARKERLESS turn — the ordinary case #955 describes — and an ordinary
   * markerless turn with no compaction boundary is untouched: it still parks at `waiting`.
   *
   * ONE helper for BOTH turn-end handlers, for the reason AGENTS.md gives: they are
   * hand-duplicated, and a lifecycle change applied to one of them ships half a fix — here
   * that would mean a fresh run recovering while every Continue and every restart recovery
   * kept the bug.
   *
   * The exits, so this is not another state with no way out: the continued turn either
   * finishes (`CEZ:DONE`), parks (any marker, or a markerless boundary-free turn), fails, or
   * compacts again — and `MAX_COMPACTION_CONTINUES` consecutive compactions park the run with
