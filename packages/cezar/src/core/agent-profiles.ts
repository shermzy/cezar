/**
 * Agent profiles — a second (third, …) login of the SAME agent CLI.
 *
 * The binary never changes; only the environment does. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-klaudiusz claude`
 * is the same Claude Code talking to a different account, because that one variable relocates the
 * agent's ENTIRE per-user home: credentials, settings, projects and — the part that bites —
 * `sessions/`, so a session id only means something inside the dir it was created in.
 *
 * This module is the single maintenance surface for that vendor knowledge, and it is deliberately
 * the SIBLING of `src/agent-config/catalog.ts` rather than part of it: the catalog owns config
 * *file* knowledge (paths, formats, verbatim precedence strings), this owns the *home-relocation*
 * variable. Splitting them also keeps the layering honest — `agent-config/` may import `paths.ts`,
 * while this is imported BY the runners, provider auth and the terminal handoff.
 *
 * Pure by construction: no filesystem, no `process.env`, nothing to stub. Resolution against the
 * workspace config lives in `src/workspace/agent-profiles.ts`.
 *
 * Facts verified against the shipped CLIs on 2026-07-29.

/**
 * Which env var relocates each agent's whole per-user home.
 *
 * `null` means the agent has no such variable and therefore cannot carry profiles:
 *
 * - **claude** → `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Documented; moves credentials, settings, projects, sessions.
 * - **codex** → `CODEX_HOME`. Documented; `auth.json` lives inside it, so identity moves too.
 * - **opencode** → nothing usable. `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`/`OPENCODE_CONFIG` move CONFIG ONLY;
 *   credentials live in its DATA dir — `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` on 1.18.1, as
 *   `opencode auth list` prints — which neither variable moves.
 *   A config-dir-only profile would swap settings while still billing the other account — the UI
 *   would say "Work" and the run would not be — so OpenCode is unsupported until it documents a
 *   single home variable. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is rejected regardless: it is machine-wide and would
 *   relocate every other XDG-aware tool the agent's own Bash calls touch.
 * - **cursor** → `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` exists and is honoured for the default profile's home
 *   (`paths.ts`), but a second-account carry through it is unverified against a real Cursor
 *   login the way Claude's was. `null` until that is confirmed rather than assumed.
 * - **pi** → nothing documented. pi ships no per-user home variable of its own, so — exactly like
 *   OpenCode — a second account cannot be carried without silently billing the wrong one. `null`
 *   until pi documents a single home variable that moves credentials as well as config.
 * - **junie** → nothing documented. Its shim's `JUNIE_DATA` relocates only the installed BINARY
 *   versions directory (`~/.local/share/junie`); the actual per-user state — `secure_credentials.json`,
 *   `config.json`, `sessions/` — lives under `~/.junie` with no override var in `junie --help`
 *   (`--config-location`/`--cache-dir` add or redirect narrower pieces, not the whole home). `null`
 *   until junie documents one, same rule as OpenCode/pi.
 * - **copilot** → `COPILOT_HOME` moves config and state, but whether it also moves the stored
 *   login has not been tested, and Copilot reads `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` /
 *   `GITHUB_TOKEN` ahead of any stored credential regardless. `null` until a test proves one
 *   variable moves both (spec 2026-09-19-runner-seam-native-backends Q14) — being wrong here
 *   bills the wrong account.
