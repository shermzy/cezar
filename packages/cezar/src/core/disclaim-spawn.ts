/**
 * macOS privacy prompts name the RESPONSIBLE process, and every process the desktop app starts
 * inherits the app as its responsible process. Left alone, an agent that lists `~/Documents`
 * raises "Cezar would like to access files in your Documents folder" — and an Allow there hands
 * every agent, forever, what one of them asked for.
 *
 * The desktop shell exports `CEZ_DISCLAIM_EXEC`: its own executable, which, run as
 * `<exe> --cez-disclaim-exec <program> <args…>`, replaces itself (same pid, same stdio) with
 * `program` as its own responsible process. Agent backends are started through it, so the prompt
 * names the agent (`claude`, `codex`, …) and a grant covers that agent only. The cockpit server
 * itself stays the app's — the folder picker's prompts are still Cezar's, which they should be.
 *
 * Anywhere else — no desktop shell, not macOS, a program that does not resolve — the command is
 * returned untouched, so a missing binary still fails the spawn with the usual ENOENT and hint.
 * The one exception: on Windows a node-script program (`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.js`) is run by node, so a
 * missing script there starts node and fails with "Cannot find module", not ENOENT and the hint.
