/** Real URLs, no basename: the cockpit is always mounted at the origin root, and the server
 *  serves index.html for every non-/api GET (src/server/static-ui.ts), so a deep link like
 *  `/tasks/:id/changes` cold-loads and survives a refresh.
 *
 *  The shell is inside BrowserRouter because its nav reads the current location, and inside
 *  QueryClientProvider because its chips read `/api/health` and `/api/todos`. Each chip renders
 *  nothing until its query answers — no placeholder that would read as real data.
 *
 *  GlobalEventsProvider sits here, at the root, because the app gets exactly one `/api/events`
 *  stream: it is mounted for the app's whole life, above every route, so navigating never drops
 *  and reopens it — and it publishes the live usage map to anything below.
