 * The one answer to "in what order do the projects go?" (#952).

 * registry listed in two different orders in the same cockpit is a bug the user reads as a
 * glitch. The palette layers its own "active project last" rule on top; it does not re-sort.
 *
 * The stored order (`ui-state.json` → `sidebar.projectOrder`) is a hand-picked list of project
 * ids, and it is deliberately NOT authoritative on its own: the registry is, so this module
 * treats the stored list as a preference to apply to whatever is actually registered right now.
 * That is what keeps a hand-edited, stale or partial list from ever hiding a project.
