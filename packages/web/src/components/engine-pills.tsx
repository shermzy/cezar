 * The remembered engine pick (#906), read out of the same `cez-followup-selection` store that

 * It lives here rather than in either route for the reason stated at the top of this file: these
 * two start surfaces must not drift, and "is the pick remembered at all" was the one axis the
 * shared component did not own — so they drifted. The GitHub tab's pick was plain `useState`,
 * reset to "never touched" on every mount, and "never touched" is exactly the state `resolveModel`
 * resolves to `defaultModels[runner]` — which `configAnswer` seeds from the coding agent's OWN
 * settings file. The result was that a user who picks `auto` every single time still got every
 * hand-off pinned to whatever `~/.claude/settings.json` names, i.e. silently upgraded to the most
 * expensive model on the host.
 *
 * The `account` is deliberately NOT persisted. Its `null` does not mean "no opinion, fall back to
 * a native file" — it means "follow the project's selection, and keep following it if that setting
 * changes" (see `EnginePick`). Remembering it would freeze a per-project setting into a per-browser
