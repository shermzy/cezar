 * reload and survive a `cez` restart, which rules out the localStorage stores `/new`
 * (`new-task-draft.ts`) and the GitHub hand-off box (`hand-to-agent-draft.ts`) use. It also has its
 * own route family and its own files under `.ai/cezar/drafts/` rather than a key in
 * `ui-state.json`: that file's PUT is capped at 128 KiB, merges shallowly, and is read whole on
 * every cockpit load — none of which survives contact with a 20 MB attachment draft.
