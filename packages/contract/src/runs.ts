/**
 * The RUNS family of `/api/v1` — a task's record, its lifecycle mutations, and the artifacts
 * (queued prompt stack, commits, git actions) that hang off one run.
 *
 * The record itself is persisted by `src/runs/store.ts`, so these schemas describe a shape that
 * already has a zod definition server-side; they are the WIRE half of it, and the parity guard in
 * `src/server/contract-parity.runs.test.ts` is what keeps the two from drifting.
 *
 * Two things about the mutation responses are deliberate and were measured, not assumed:
 *
 *  - every "did it work" flag is a `z.literal(true)`, not a boolean. Each of those routes answers
 *    409 (or 404) on refusal, so `false` is not a value the 200 branch can carry — the
 *    hand-written DTO's `boolean` invited a re-check the server never needs. `cancelled` is the
 *    one real boolean: `POST /runs/:id/cancel` answers 200 either way.
 *  - `POST /runs/:id/messages` answers a three-way UNION, not one object with three optional
 *    keys. The client narrows on which key is present, and the DTO's flattened shape allowed
 *    `{}` — a payload the route cannot produce.
